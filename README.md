# project2

In this project we explored The Happiness Index around the world and deployed the information on an interactive dashboard: https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/
There are 7 key metrics of measurement that together, make up the final Happiness Index. Thes 7 areas of measurement are:

GDP Per Capita   Social Support   Life Expectancy   Freedom   Generosity   Corruption   Happiness Rating


# The project objectives were:

1- Utilise and analyse data from "The Happiness Report" retrieved from Kaggle (https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/datatable).

2- Visualise the Happiness scores across various locations (countries) around the world (https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/map).

3- Assess the frequency distribution of countries' happiness scores across the world and per continent (https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/histogram).

4- Analyse the correlation between world happiness and factors influencing happiness (https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/scatter).
