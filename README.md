# project2

In this project we explored The Happiness Index around the world and deployed the information on an interactive dashboard: https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/
There are 7 key metrics of measurement that together, make up the final Happiness Index. These 7 areas of measurement are:

GDP Per Capita   Social Support   Life Expectancy   Freedom   Generosity   Corruption   Happiness Rating


# The project objectives were:

1- Utilise and analyse data from "The Happiness Report" retrieved from Kaggle (https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/datatable).

2- Visualise the Happiness scores across various locations (countries) around the world (/map).

3- Assess the frequency distribution of countries' happiness scores across the world and per continent (/histogram).

4- Analyse the correlation between world happiness and factors influencing happiness (/scatter).


# Conclusions from this analysis:

Happiness across the world. https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/map

The world map visualization by year shows country-by-country colored according to their ‘happiness scores’. The 2020 representation below shows countries with the lowest scores in red/purple and countries with the highest scores in blue/green, countries with missing scores for that particular year are in grey. Hover the mouse over specific countries in the live page to see their happiness score and GDP per capita values. As an example, Australia is a country with a high happiness score (7.137) and high GDP per capita.

Happiness distribution between continents. https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/histogram

In 2020, as an example, the majority of the countries around the world (60 in total) scored in the bracket 5-7. Only 2 countries scored within the lowest bracket 2-3, while 14 countries scored in the highest bracket 7-8.
The analysis by continent shows that:
The majority of African countries scored 4-5, followed by Asian countries that scored between 4-7 and South American countries between 5-7.
Countries in North America, Europe and Oceania presented the highest happiness scores. Interestingly, North American countries had a split distribution with countries in the score range 5-6 and 7-8. The majority of European countries scored in the 6-7 range and Oceania is the 7-8 range.

Correlation analysis between happiness and other factors. https://happiness25.herokuapp.com/scatter

Scatter plots allowed us to assess the relationship between parameters that might influence happiness scores. We observe a positive strong correlation between happiness scores and GDP per capita, life expectancy and social support and no apparent relationship between these factors with scores for generosity and freedom.
